About the Code Structure
=========================

The app is ``Tamtam`` folder. The main activity is at `TamTamMainActivity.java`. The "interesting code" which perform the 
Image processing part is an implementation of CvCameraViewListener2, a callback which called for each frame in a video stream.
There are several implementations left in the code form previous experiments we did but the version that is actually used is 
at `ImgHandlerTresh.java`.
The other implementations left in the code as reference to the way we made during the development and as place for us to found source 
samples for correct OpenCV usage in Java.

Under the folder ``experiments`` we saved ipython notebook contains early sketches of our algorithm + some videos that we 
used for testing during the development.
There is detailed README.txt there that can be used in order to set-up experiments environment as we used.
